function figuresize( w , h , u )
%FIGURESIZE Set a figure to a specific size
%
% When saving a figure as a PDF, it is necessary to set the
% figure size appropriately. This function sets the "paper size"
% sufficient that the figure is saved with a tight bounding box.
% It will also set the figure size on screen correspondingly.
%
% figuresize(width,height) - sets the figure size in centimeters
% figuresize(width,height,units) - sets the figure size in <units>
%
% <units> can be any of the standard Matlab lengths.
